conceptual introduction to data engineering

data engineers build data pipelines

chapter 1
    what is data engineering?

chapter 2
    hwo data storages work?

chapter 3
    how to move and process data?


on a company, the data workflow is usually:

data collection and storage
    from web traffic, surveys, extraction

data preparation

exploration and visualization

experimentation and prediction

the role of the data engineer is:
    deliver correct data in the right form, to the right people, as efficient as possible

big data: data that is so large that, when manipulated, engineers have to consider it size as a feature

five Vs - features of big data 
    volume, variety, velocity (how frequent do we need to deal with it?), 
    veracity (accuracy), value (how useful?)

data engineer: strong software skills
data analyst/scientist: strong analitc skills


data pipelines automate steps to provide data how it is supposed to, that is:
    extracting, transforming, combining, validating and loading (ETL)

    it reduces human intervention, erros and time it takes data to flow
