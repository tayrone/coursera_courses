what is data engineering
    the data engineer's task is to make the data scientist's life easier
    he can:
        gather data from different sources and into a single database
        optimize the database for analyses, and not for applications
        remove corrupt data

    a data engineer can be defined as "an engineer that developes, 
        constructs,tests and mantains architectures such as databases 
        and large scale data processing systems"

    data engineer tasks
        develop scalable data architecture
        streamline data acquisition
        set up processes to gather data
        clean corrupt data
        he also should be well versed in cloud technology

    data scientist tasks
        mine data for patterns
        make statistical modeling
        apply predictive models using machine learning
        monitor business processes
        clean outliers in data



tools of the data engineer
    database systems
        systems that hold large amounts of data
        they usually support applications
        can also be built to support analyses
        e.g., mySQL, postgreSQL

    tools for data processing
        needed to clean, aggregate and join data from multiple sources
        usually parallel processing clusters and are applied on this
        e.g., spark, hive

    scheduling tools
        assure data move from one place to another at the correct time,
            in the correct order
        e.g., airflow, oozie

    an example of data pipeline:
        the engineer extracts all data from multiple databases,
            or even APIs for example
        then transforms it using a cluster computing framework
        then loads it into an analytic database
        also, everything is scheduled by an orchestrator (e.g., airflow)
        

cloud processing
    it's possible to use the resource when you need, at the amount needed

    the big three providers
        aws, azure abd google

    storage
        aws S3, azuzre blob storage, google cloud storage
        
    computation
        aws EC2, azure virtual machines, google compute engineer

    databases
        aws RDS, azure SQL database, google cloud SQL
