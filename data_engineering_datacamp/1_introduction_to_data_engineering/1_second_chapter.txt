what are databases
    usually alarge collection of data,
        organized for rapid search and retrieval

    it holds and organizes data


structured data
    relational databases

semi-structured data
    e.g., JSON files

unstructured data
    schemaless, more like files
    videos, photos

SQL
    tables, database schema, relational databases
    e.g., mySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL
    non-relational databases
    structured or unstructured
    e.g., redis (key-value stores), mongoDB (document databases)


SQL - database schema
    it defines all tables, variables, 
        and how tables relate to each other

star schema
    one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables
    



parallel computing

main idea
    split taskas into subtasks, over severall computers

benefits
    greater processing power
    less memory usage by computer

risks
    necessity for communication between nodes
    



parallel computation frameworks
    hadoop projects
        map reduce
            big data processing paradigm


        HDFS
            distributed file system
            storage systems like S3 now replace HDFS

    spark
        avoid disk writes, unlike map reduce
        mantains most possible processing in memory

        relies on RDD (resilient distributed datasets)
            you can think of them as list of tuples

        transformations
            .map(), filter()
        actions
            .count(), first()

        pyspark is the python interface to spark
            it uses a data frame abstraction, not SQL



workflow scheduling frameworks

    DAG (directed acyclic graph)
        set of nodes
        directed edges
        no cycles

    airflow
        tool for workflow management
