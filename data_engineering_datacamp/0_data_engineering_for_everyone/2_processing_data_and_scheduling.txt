data processing
    convert raw data into meaningful information

data processing value
    remove unwanted data
    save memory
    change file formats
    organize data (from lake to warehouse, let's say)
    fit data in a certain structure

data engineers role in data processing
    cleaning and tidying
    store data in sanely structured databases
    create views on top of databases
    make data efficient to retrieve 

scheduling
    is responsible for organizing how tasks will run in a specific order

    three ways of scheduling data
        manually, at a specific time, or if a condition is met

data can be processed in batches or streaming
    batches
        can be cheaper
    streaming


parallel computing
    the basis of modern data processing tools

    advantages 
        memory and processing power

    disadvantages
        moving data incurs a cost
        communication between processes


cloud computing
    servers on premises
        need to be bought
        need physical space
        have electrical and maintenance cost
        processing power is unused at quieter times

    servers on the cloud
        is rented
        there is no need for physical space
        you can only use the resources you need, when you need
        closer the user, less is the latency

    cloud computing storage:
        data replication in another location, for backup

    main cloud providers
    aws, microsoft azure, and google cloud
