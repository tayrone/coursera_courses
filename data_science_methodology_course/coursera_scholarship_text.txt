I am a 26 year old Brazilian engineer with a master's degree in Bioinformatics. Currently, I am unemployed, living in my parents home, and seeking to break into the data science field. Unfortunately, my previous academic experiences lacked in some really important topics that are essential to data science positions, such as statistics applied on data science projects and data science methodology.

With the aim to become a complete data scientist in the future, I searched for online courses that would help myself develop the skills I lack the most. Doing that, I was introduced to this Data Science Methodology course, which I believe would be of great help for me landing a data science job in the future.

I am extremely curious about everything related to data science and I truly believe I will thrive on this course, if given the opportunity to enroll. I am sure this would be of tremendous help for me on landing my first data science job.

This course will be essential for me to obtain knowledge in a topic that I have never studied before, which is Data Science Methodology. Without the knowledge related to this, I believe it will be extremely hard for me to land a data science job in the next few months.

I completely trust Coursera as an educational platform and, since I have no knowledge on this specific field, it would completely dive into the course material, as I am eager to learn about the topics it discusses.

After completing this course, I strongly believe I will be much more confident and comfortable on doing data science tests from any selection process I may apply to. This will give the "step-by-step" knowledge necessary to tackle any project I need to implement from now on, which is something I currently do not have. This is one of the last adjustments I need to do in order to be successful on future selection processes.
